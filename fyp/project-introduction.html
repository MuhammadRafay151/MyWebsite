                    Introduction
                    <p> Certification has found its way into almost every industry for a reason: It helps advance the
                        profession. Certification helps employers assess potential new hires, evaluate job performance,
                        evaluate workers, pick contractors, market resources, and encourage employees to develop
                        their skills and abilities. Certification provides recognition of skills, demonstrates devotion
                        to the profession, and assists with career advancement. There has been an explosive growth in
                        professional certification. Professional Certification helps one to:
                    <ul>

                            fulfill job responsibilities in the real world.</li>

                    Problems
                    <p>
                        The problem is that different certificates for events, courses, health, etc. are issued to the
                        people
                        from different organizations. But in case of any mishaps (natural disaster, misplace, etc.)
                        person
                        might lose his/her certificate, Sometime the organization shift the platform so it is very
                        difficult
                        process to get that certificate again due to lots of hurdles, verifying those certificates is
                        really
                        big issue, sometime if it is possible so it is very time consuming and costly process and
                        sometime it is not possible due to lack of backup also preparing and distributing those
                        certificates manually is so much time consuming.

                    Solution
                    <p>
                        We are providing a platform of blockchain based e-certification CERTIFIS which provides a
                        way to verify the certificates not only by the certificate generating entity also by other users
                        (either the part of any entity in the network or not) and in case any entity loss their data or
                        change their platform then the certificates issued by them still be verifiable.
                        The Blockchain based e-certification project will meet the following objectives:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Provide distributed platform for verifiability of certificate.</li>
                        <li>No certificate or data loss due to any mishap.</li>
                        <li>Tamper free securable environment.</li>
                    </ul>
